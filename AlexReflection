My project was a safe, which would be opened by a RFID card and 2 servos, along with 2 LEDs and a passive buzzer. 
This project was relatively easy, as I was able to manage my time well, and spread the workload across the span of a few weeks.
The hardest part of the project was probably coding the RFID ID, which took me a while to figure out, as I did not know how to get the UID code from the serial monitor.
My favourite part of the project
